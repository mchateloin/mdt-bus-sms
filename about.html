        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>To say using public transportation in Miami is a challenge would be an understatement. In recent years, the county has tried to change the perception of public transportation and increase awareness and ridership by adding more bus stops, express routes and amenities such as free WIFI.</p>
        <p>In May 2013 alone, there were more than 6.5 million boardings on Miami-Dade County’s Metrobus system, according to the Ridership Technical Report. To make it easier for these public transportation users, Miami-Dade Transit created an app that uses geolocation to identify where users are and provide information on upcoming bus times; however, there are multiple issues with the app. The app interface is not user-friendly, the functionality is slow, and it is only available in English. And the biggest issue is that it is not accessible to individuals who do not have a smartphone or generous data plans.</p>

        <p>As of May 2013, 91% of American adults have a cell phone, but only 56% of American adults have a smartphone, according to the Pew Research Center. That means there is a huge segment of the population who can not use sophisticated apps, geolocation services, and other advanced features.</p>

        <p>The “Text My Bus MIAMI" SMS system allows anyone with even a basic cellphone to easily access upcoming bus times for a particular bus stop. This service is available in English, Spanish and Creole.</p>

        <p>Here’s how this simple text messaging service works:</p>

        <p>The Miami Dade Transit Bus passenger will text the bus stop ID to a specified phone number. The passenger will immediately receive a text with the next three times when that bus will arrive at his or her stop.</p>
        <p>In the future, there is the possibility to make this service even more valuable by providing additional information, such as alternate bus routes and previous bus times.</p>
